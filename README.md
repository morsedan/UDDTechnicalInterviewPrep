# Underdog Devs Technical Interview Prep

The purpose of this repo is to provide a structured approach to preparing for entry-level software development position interviews. 

Everyone learns at a different pace. Don't compare how quickly you progress through this material to how quickly others do. It won't help you.

The material tested in technical interviews is generally summed up as Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Prerequisite: Big O
Computers have two resources, processing time and memory space. In order to understand why one data structure or algorithm is better than another, we need a way to measure how fast they run and how much memory they use. Big O is the most common way of measuring these resources. How much processing time an operation takes is referred to as **time complexity**. How much memory it uses is called **space complexity**. Before you dive into the study of data structures and algorithms you should have a basic understanding of Big O. Read through the article below or watch the video. Take a look at the items under Resources as well.

After looking through this material, if you still have questions (and you probably will), reach out to your mentor or ask in Slack. Once you think you have a basic understanding of run-time complexity and space complexity, move on to Data Structures.

## Data Structures

Data structures are simply a way of storing data. These ways of storing data were conceived to solve some problem. The basic data structures are below:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions that solves a problem. Some common categories of algorithms are listed below:

- Recursion
- Sorting
- General Problem Solving
