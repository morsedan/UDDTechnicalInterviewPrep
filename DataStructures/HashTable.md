# Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that has very fast search, insertion, and retrieval. What does that mean? It means that in can search for data, insert data, and retrieve data in constant time. This is a very good thing. This is often useful for avoiding nested for-loops, always a good thing.

So what is a hash table? A hash table is a way of storing data where the "location" of the data is related to the data it's storing. The way this works is by turning the data into a number, called a **hash**. It then uses that number like an address for where to find it. This is probably confusing. The video should help clarify all of this. I'd recommend watching the video and going through the article for this one.

Make sure to implement resizing the hash table. This is referred to at the end of the article. You may need to get help from your mentor or in the Slack channel.
