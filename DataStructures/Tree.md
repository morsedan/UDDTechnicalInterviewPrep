# Tree

If you've seen a family tree, you're already familiar with the concept of a tree. Like a linked list, a tree is made up of nodes. You have a **root node** at the top of a tree. The root node holds references to a number of **child nodes**. In most trees the number of children any **parent node** has is not limited. However, there are particular types of trees that do limit the number of children a node can have. For example a **binary tree** limits the number of children to two. Here's a cool thing about trees, any node can be a root node. The implication of that fact is that trees are a perfect chance to use **recursion**. 

At this point, I would suggest taking the time to either go through the Recursion module, or at least familiarize yourself with the concept of recursion.
