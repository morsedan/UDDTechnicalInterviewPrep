# Queue

A queue (pronounced like the letter "q") is like a line at the grocery store. The first person to get in line is the first person to check out. This is known as first in, first out (FIFO). The term used to put something into a queue is "enqueue", to remove is "de-queue"

Because a queue is so similar to a stack, see if you can implement it on your own [here](https://github.com/morsedan/UDDTechnicalInterviewPrep/blob/main/DataStructures/Queue/Queue/main.swift). Or [here](https://github.com/morsedan/UDDTechnicalInterviewPrep/blob/main/DataStructures/Queue/Queue.py) if you use Python.

Stacks and queues will be very useful when you get to working with trees and graphs. 

If you have any questions, ask your mentor or ask in Slack.
