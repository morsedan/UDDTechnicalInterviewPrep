# Graph

Graphs are similar to trees. In fact, a tree is a graph that follows certain rules. As you move into  more flexible data structures, you will need to cover more potential outcomes. This is why you learned linked lists (a type of tree) before you learned trees, and why you learned trees (a type of graph) before learning graphs. Simply put, a graph is a collection of nodes or **vertices** and edges. You already know what a node or **vertex** is, but what's an edge? An **edge** is a connection between two nodes. 

Graphs are great for representing real world things. A graph can easily represent a wireless network with multiple access points, like a mesh router system. A graph can represent a social network, 'person a' is friends with 'person b' and 'person c', but not with 'person d', etc. A neighborhood can be represented by a graph. Each house is a node, the streets are the edges. A forest, cities on a map, locations of commercial aircraft, board games. There's almost no limit to what a graph can represent.
