# Stack

You can think of a stack like a stack of books or a stack of cards. You put (the technical term is push) things onto the stack. Then when you take them off (the technical term is pop), whatever you put on last will come off first. A stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) data structure.

One of the best ways to ensure you actually understand a data structure is to implement it. Can you implement a stack? Your stack should be a class that has a push method and a pop method. It's ok if you need to refer back to the video or article.
