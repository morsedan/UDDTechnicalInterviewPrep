# Recursion

Recursion is when a function calls itself. You need to make sure you have a **base case**. A base case is the scenario in which a function will return before calling itself. Until a function gets to the base case, it should modify the data it's passing to get closer to the base case and call the itself with the modified data.

This will not be clear without an example. This is probably a good time to watch the video.

And now that you have a basic idea of recursion, you should practice a few different problems that use recursion.
