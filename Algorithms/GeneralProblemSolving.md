# General Problem Solving

At this point you've learned the basics of data structures and algorithms. What's next. Part of the technical interview is to communicate what you know in addition to solving the problems given. Read the free part of [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Distilled-Computational-Problems/dp/0997316020/ref=sr_1_1?crid=X7367HRB1TJ4&keywords=computer+science+distilled&qid=1637190852&sprefix=computer+science+dis%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-1) to help develop a process for organizing and communicating your thoughts.

It's time to start practicing on your own. Take a look at the following problems and see if you can solve them.

- Fizzbuzz (for 1 through a number you pass into a function, print Fizz if the number divides evenly by 3, print Buzz if it divides by 5, and print FizzBuzz if it divides by both 3 and 5, otherwise print the number)
- Integer to Roman Numeral (write a function that takes an Integer and returns a string that expresses that number using Roman Numerals, can you do the reverse [take a roman numeral string and return an integer]? )
- Find the longest palindrome in a given string (See if you can do this in one pass). [On Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)
- Run Length Encoding (take a string and return a [run length encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) string. For example, if the input string is “zzzzaaaadeeuuuuuuu”, then the function should return “z4a4de2u7”. If the input string is "baaab", return "ba3b")
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) (I find 4-6 kyu to be about as difficult as most interview questions.)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) (You can sort problems by difficulty, type, etc.)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (These generally get more difficult as the problem number increases.)
